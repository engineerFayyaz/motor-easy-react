              <h3>What Constitutes High Mileage?</h3>
              <p>
                Typically, vehicles with over 75,000 miles are considered high
                mileage. At this stage, engine components may start to wear
                down, and the engine can become more prone to leaks, deposits,
                and decreased performance. Proper maintenance becomes even more
                crucial to prevent costly repairs and extend the vehicle’s
                lifespan.

              <h3>The Importance of Regular Oil Changes</h3>
              <p>
                For high-mileage engines, regular oil changes are not just
                routine maintenance—they are a critical investment in the
                longevity and health of your car. Fresh oil lubricates and
                protects the engine’s moving parts, helps to cool engine
                components, and prevents dirt and debris from causing damage.

                <strong>Choosing the Right Oil for High Mileage Engines</strong>
              </h2>
              <br />
              <h3>High Mileage Motor Oil: What’s the Difference?</h3>
              <p>
                High-mileage motor oil is specifically designed for older
                engines. It contains additives that help reduce oil burn-off and
                emissions, improve engine performance, and protect against leaks
                by conditioning engine seals. These oils are typically more
                viscous to better coat older and worn engine parts.
              </p>
              <h3>Synthetic vs. Conventional: Which is Better?</h3>
              <p>
                While conventional oil can be suitable for some high-mileage
                vehicles, synthetic oil offers superior protection and
                performance. It is engineered to be more stable at high
                temperatures and under severe driving conditions, which helps it
                protect better and last longer. Synthetic oil is also better at
                cleaning the engine and preventing sludge build-up.

                <strong>How Often Should You Change Your Oil?</strong>
              </h2>
              <br />
              <h3>Mileage or Time Interval: What Matters Most?</h3>
              <p>
                The traditional advice has been to change your oil every 3,000
                miles. Still, many modern vehicles, especially synthetic ones,
                can go 5,000 to 7,500 miles between oil changes. However,
                adhering to a shorter interval for high-mileage vehicles might
                be beneficial. Always refer to your vehicle’s owner’s manual for
                specific recommendations.
              </p>
              <h3>Monitoring Oil Health</h3>
              <p>
                It’s also essential for high-mileage vehicle owners to monitor
                the condition of their oil between changes. Look for signs of
                excessive darkening or particles in the oil, which indicate
                contamination and can signal the need for an earlier oil change.

              <h3>Preparing Your Vehicle</h3>
              <p>
                Before starting, ensure your vehicle is on a flat surface and
                the engine is cooled down. Gather all necessary tools and
                materials, including a wrench, oil filter, new oil, funnel, and
                oil catch pan.
              </p>
              <h3>Draining Old Oil</h3>
              <p>
                Place your oil catch pan underneath the oil drain plug under the
                vehicle. Carefully remove the plug and allow the old oil to
                drain completely. Be cautious, as the oil may still be warm.
              </p>
              <h3>Replacing the Oil Filter</h3>
              <p>
                Once the oil has drained, replace the old oil filter with a new
                one. Apply a little of the new oil to the new filter’s gasket;
                this helps ensure a good seal.
              </p>
              <h3>Adding New Oil</h3>
              <p>
                Pour the new oil into the engine via the fill hole using a
                funnel. Be sure not to overfill—check your owner’s manual for
                the correct amount.
              </p>
              <h3>Checking Your Work</h3>
              <p>After replacing the fill cap and wiping away any spills:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Start your vehicle and let it run for a few minutes.</li>
                <li>Check for leaks, and then turn off the engine.</li>
                <li>
                  After a few minutes, check the oil level with the dipstick and
                  add more if necessary.
                </li>
              </ul>
